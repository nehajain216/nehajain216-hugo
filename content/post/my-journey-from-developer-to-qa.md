In this article, I would like to share my journey of moving from a Developer to QA role.

## Started Career as a Developer
I started my career as a .NET developer and worked on building some web applications using C# .NET.
After a couple of years, I joined another organization where they were using a commercial tool built on top of .NET.
Working with that platform is both interesting and challenging too. As it is a closed-source commercial platform there is no online help available.
If you get stuck with any problem you got to resolve by yourself or take help from your colleagues.
But with that platform, the overall software delivery process is very streamlined.
Most of the features such as user management, role based security, automated CI/CD process etc is baked into the platform itself.

## Stepping into Tech Lead role
During this timeframe I was promoted from Developer to a Tech Lead position.
As a Tech Lead I was responsible for overall delivery of the project, not just for my own tasks.
So, the amount of time I spent on implementing the features myself gradually decreased and I used to spend lot of time coordinating between business folks and the tech team.

While occasionally feel like I am not coding much myself, I realized that as a Tech Lead my value is in helping the team to deliver the project with better quality.
So, I used to spend a lot of time testing the features developed by other team members before releasing to the customers. I am still proud that we released 3 versions back to back with zero defects which happened never before in that project.

## Career Break and Coming Back
Then I took a career break due to personal reasons and after a couple of years I started looking for job opportunities.
Luckily, ThoughtWorks was running Vapasi program where they help people who took a career break and looking for restarting their career again.
I had gone through the program, re-learned many things and finally got the job offer as an Application Developer.

Compared to my previous development experience this is very different. 
There are a million frameworks, libraries, design patterns, testing frameworks etc etc. It's really overwhelming.
I was assigned to a project where we were using SpringBoot with a bunch of libraries. 
We build the app, delivered it on time and even got appreciation from the client.

## Finding my interests
I quickly realized that building a software product is not all about coding. 
There are many important aspects apart from coding and many people contribute to the success of a product in different ways.

While developers play a key role of implementing the features, there is much more to building a software product.
There are Business Analysts who talk to business folks to understand their needs and translate them as requirements for tech team.
There are QAs who test the application to ensure the application is working as expected. There are project managers who ensure the necessary info and resources are given to the team to build the application. In order to deliver a project successfully, there are so many ways to contribute and each role is important.

One of my core strengths is I pay attention to the details, and I am good at tying the loose-ends by collaborating with stakeholders and bring clarity to the table.
And, I realized that QA plays a key role in understanding the business domain and ensuring the software does what it is supposed to do.

Considering my interests and my prior experience I thought of moving to QA role.
My team at ThoughtWorks understand my interests and offer guidance to move into QA role as well.
While testing is not entirely new to me as a software developer, I realized there are many things to learn to step into QA role.

## QA Mindset
As a QA my goal to ensure the application is released with good quality, not to find as many bugs as I can.
There is a difference in "finding as many bugs as you can" vs "ensuring the quality of application".
As a QA I am not here to find holes in developers work. I am here to make sure the application is working as expected and testing is a key step to achieve that.

But there are many other things that we can do to achieve better quality:

* Talk to BAs, understand the customer needs and how they are going to use the application.
* Understand what are the key features and what are "nice-to-have" features.
* Participate in requirement analysis and help the team to get a "common understanding" of a feature we are going to build.
* Giving timely feedback to developers on the findings helps them fix the issues as quickly as possible.

## Test Automation
In todays fast paced software development world, Automated Testing is a key to be agile.
There is no way to manually test everything to ensure not only new features are working but existing functionality is not broken for every release.
You  got to automate this so that regression is performed automatically.
Again, we may not automate 100% of the testing, we should aim to automate the testing process as much as we can.

## Know how much testing is enough
As a QA it is tempting to test the application thouroughly to make it 100% bug free. But we are living in a real world where there are time constraints.
Especially for startups time-to-market is key. As QAs, we need to plan and prioritize the efforts so that all the key features are working as expected.

## Keep Learning
Some people see QA as "boring job" which is totally incorrect in my opinion.
In fact, being a QA is "more interesting" because as QA you not only understand much more about the bsuiness side of the application, you get to write code to automate the repetitive work.

There are many awesome frameworks and libraries for automation testing like Selenium, Cypress, PlayWrite etc.
It's never boring to watch your automated tests firing up a browser window, filling all those form fields and submitting it :-)

And, at times it is very challenging write automated tests for scenarios which involves human interaction like entering OTPs, activating accounts via email etc.
So, you need to be willing to learn.

## Conlusion
Overall, I see QA as an important role in the software development process and I am really enjoying it.
Going forward I will share my learnings along the way, so stay tuned.
